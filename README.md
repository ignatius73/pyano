# Pyano python class to merge two given CSV and returning a new one. 


With two csv files provided, returns one with the real user_id from the system.

Problems:

The domain provided only responded with a html file.

I tested with some endpoints encountered in the documentation but these doesn't works with the domain provided.

So, I decided program an example of how the app will get the data and I created a simulated_data.json for testing.
